# Experiment 8

## Aim of the Experiment
To implement Congestion control using Leaky bucket algorithm

### Steps or procedure of Experiment
1.Start
2.Set the bucket size or the buffer size.
3.Set the output rate.
4.Transmit the packets such that there is no overflow.
5.Repeat the process of transmission until all packets are transmitted. (Reject packets where its size is greater than the bucket size)
6.Stop

### Output
